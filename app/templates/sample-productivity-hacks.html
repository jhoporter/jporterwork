      <p>Everyone wants to be productive. Everyone wants to achieve the results they desire.</p>

      <p>But how can you produce these intended results if, paradoxically, the more work you put in, the farther you’re getting from the finish line?</p>

      <p>If you’ve started to feel like you’re not as productive as you used to be, it’s time to take a step back and come up with a strategy to improve your productivity.</p>

      <p>Perhaps you’ve been trying to do too many things at once. And if you are, you need to stop this, as you’re only making it more difficult for yourself to accomplish anything.</p>

      <p>Focus on just one thing. Use the art of mindfulness to boost your productivity and make your life easier.</p>

      <h2>Take A Moment To Breathe</h2>

      <p>One of the quickest and easiest ways to increase your productivity is by mindfully taking a few breaths. Take note that being mindful is being in the present.</p>

      <p>It’s being fully aware of your surroundings. Of your thoughts. Of your actions.</p>

      <p>Sure, you don’t need to think about breathing as your body automatically does it for you, but that’s not what mindfulness is.</p>

      <p>You’re being mindful when you stop in the middle of something to actively take deep breaths. When you do this when you’re feeling too overwhelmed to be productive, your mind will be eventually cleared, enabling you to focus on finishing your task.</p>

      <h2>Figure Out What You Truly Feel</h2>

      <p>Have you ever stopped to think about why you’re not feeling productive?</p>

      <p>Think about it. Do you feel rushed?</p>

      <p>Do you feel lost because you’re doing multiple things at the same time?</p>

      <p>Or maybe you’ve lost hope? Maybe you’re upset thinking that you’re never going to finish what you’re working on?</p>

      <p>When you figure out what you’re truly feeling, write it down and try to understand why you feel this way. Then figure out what you need to do to get rid of this feeling. Maybe there’s something else that must be done first before you proceed with your current project. Maybe you’re having trouble focusing on completing your task because your mind is elsewhere, thinking about doing the laundry or cleaning the kitchen or whatever. If this is the case, do what’s bothering you first so you can finally take your mind off of it and can focus on what you were doing.</p>

      <h2>Acceptance Is Key</h2>

      <p>There are times when you simply cannot do everything.</p>

      <p>And that’s okay. You just have to accept that.</p>

      <p>Once you’ve accepted that you can’t control certain things, you’ll be able to let it go. Then you can finally focus on things that you actually CAN control.</p>

      <p>Make a to-do list and separate the things you can control from the things you can’t. Let this list remind you what things you can handle by yourself. Use it to motivate yourself. Use it to improve your focus.</p>

      <p>Remember: the only way to start and maintain good habits is by practicing them regularly. So practice mindfulness every chance you get so that it sticks.</p>

      <p>You might know what you want or need, but you won’t be able to get it if your mind is elsewhere.</p>

      <p>Really try your best to be present. And use your mindfulness routine in ways that increase your productivity.</p>
