      <p>If you Google how to make money online, the results are virtually endless. There are tons of online resources that feature a list of things you can do to make this happen. But making money online is never as easy as these internet sources make it sound. If it was, everyone would be swimming in cash by now. The truth of the matter is that, the majority of these schemes don’t work. And those that do only do so for a small number of people. However, there are guaranteed ways to generate passive income, one of them being continuity marketing.</p>
      <h2>What is continuity marketing?</h2>
      <p>Think of it this way: imagine having a subscription where you pay a monthly fee to receive a product or service every month until you cancel that subscription. You as the consumer only needed to buy the product or service once, but the company continues to profit off of you until you decide you no longer want it.</p>
      <p>Now, what if you had your own continuity product to offer? You would be generating passive income just like these companies.</p>
      <p>If that’s not enough to pique your interest, maybe the numbers will. According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/thinking-inside-the-subscription-box-new-research-on-ecommerce-consumers" target="_blank">this study</a>, the subscription e-commerce market grew by over 100% a year from 2012 to 2017. The biggest players in the field went from making $57 million in 2011 to over $2.6 billion in 2016. That’s a massive increase. The same study also discovered that 15% of online shoppers had signed up for at least one continuity program. But that was in 2017—three years ago. Times have changed. There are more internet users now than ever before, and online shopping has only gotten more prevalent.</p>
      <h2>Why sell continuity products?</h2>
      <p><strong>Increased profits</strong>. This is definitely the main benefit of continuity programs. If a customer buys from you once, all you’re getting is a one-time payment. But if they buy a subscription, you’ll continue to receive payments for heaven knows how long. And it takes about the same effort and energy to sell a one-time purchase product as it does to sell a continuity product.</p>
      <p><strong>Repeat customers</strong>. Once a customer buys a continuity product, they automatically become a repeat customer. And if they’ve already bought a subscription from you, they will be more likely to buy another one. For example, if your customer currently has a subscription for moisturizer, it’s likely they will buy a sunscreen subscription if you’re also offering that.</p>
      <p><strong>Guaranteed recurring income</strong>. As long as your customers deem your product essential and you provide superior experiences, they won’t feel any need to cancel their subscription. Even if they start feeling like they want to cancel, they probably don’t want to go through all the hassle of doing that so they’ll end up putting it off for a long time. Maybe even years.</p>
      <p><strong>It saves time</strong>. When you get repeat customers automatically, you spend less time looking for new customers. This will allow you to put more time into growing your continuity business or focusing on other ventures.</p>
      <h2>Creating your own continuity product</h2>
      <p>Just the thought of creating your own continuity product can be overwhelming. Where or how do you even start? Well, you could start with the things you like and activities you’re good at. Find your niche and figure out if you have the skill set required to launch and sell a particular product. Check out the following types of continuity products to see if any of them is a good fit:</p>
      <p><strong>Subscriptions</strong>. If you’re interested in selling physical products, you could start a subscription for things you craft: knitted or crocheted items, homebrewed beer or other drinks, scented candles, homemade soap and many more.</p>
      <p><strong>Memberships</strong>. Many newspapers, magazines and blog sites offer this type of service to their readers. If you have a blog site or if you’re an influencer, you could collect a monthly membership fee in exchange for giving your subscribers exclusive content that they won’t find elsewhere. This is also how paid newsletters work.</p>
      <p><strong>Software Services</strong>. Examples include streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, web hosts like DreamHost, autoresponder and email services, password management tools, and social media monitoring tools. But unless you’re in the software industry, creating a new software service is probably nearly impossible.</p>
      <p>But what if you can’t figure out what physical product to sell, don’t have the ability to start a software service, or don’t have an existing group of online followers? That’s fine. You could still make money with continuity products.</p>
      <h2>Taking a short cut through recurring affiliate marketing</h2>
      <p>You don’t actually need to make your own product to reap the benefits of continuity programs. You just need to find recurring affiliate programs, be an affiliate and get people to buy them. As long as these customers continue to pay their monthly fees, you’ll continue to earn a commission. In some cases, you can even earn up to 50-60% commission on every transaction.</p>
      <p>This is the easiest and fastest way to make monthly passive income with continuity products. You don’t have to worry about creating and/or maintaining your product, offering any type of customer service, product deliveries and everything else involved in selling a product. You don’t even really need to have your own website. As an affiliate, you’ll have your own affiliate link which you can then give to potential customers. You get paid a commission if any of them buys a product through your link.</p>
      <p>The entire process is really easy. The problem is, finding recurring affiliate programs that pay good money can be hard and time-consuming. Some people simply don’t have the knack of finding these things on the internet. The good news is that there is another shortcut: finding a list of recurring affiliate programs that guarantee results. If you don’t want to spend weeks looking for these programs, check out the book Affiliate Rebill Riches 3.0. It’s offering 17 lists of affiliate programs in different niches. You’ll have access to over 250 programs, all of which were researched manually to make sure they actually work.</p>
      <h2>Continuity marketing is where the money’s at</h2>
      <p>Society has entered the era of online shopping. What better time to get started with continuity marketing than now? It doesn’t matter whether you have your own product or you’re promoting other people’s products—as long as you’re in the game, you’ll generate passive income for the months and perhaps even years to come.</p>
